# My [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org) Config

I've mooved my config to [christopher-besch/configs](https://github.com/christopher-besch/configs).

After installing LunarVim, you'll have to run `mkdir -p ~/.local/share/lunarvim/site/spell` because of [a bug](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim/issues/1445).
You should also make sure that `fd-find` and `xclip` are installed.

- `z` for folding
